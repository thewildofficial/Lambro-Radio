- use https://animate-ui.com/ for animated components

- Always use ShadCN components where applicable.

- to add components, use command: npx shadcn@latest add <component>

- Use Context7 MCP Tool to find applicable components and packages if you don't know about one. You can also use this to know about a library or a package. 

- You can also use search and Fetch MCP Tools for something that Context7 can't satisfy
.
- If the user provides a URL for a component or package then use the fetch tool to scrape
it and use that.

- Maintain a list of used ShadCN components in ShadCN-context.md (make one if it doesn't exist). It should contain all the components used and reference this to check if you need
to install a ShadCN component from scratch with the CLI tool or not

- finally, use playwright to test your changes and verify that the UI is satisfactory and up to standards, if not, iteratively fix the UX
